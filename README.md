# Android-Countries

Provides country codes in accordance with ISO-3166-1 and localized names for each country

## Installation

 * Create a new library project from this repository and reference it in your project

## Usage

### Custom country preference in your `PreferenceActivity`

Add the following code to your XML for the preferences. The class `CountryPreference` extends `ListPreference` and has the same appearance. It ignores the attributes `android:entries`, `android:entryValues`, `android:defaultValue` and `android:summary` because it comes with its own implementation for those.

Be sure to set `android:key` to the preference key that you want to store the country code in. For `android:title`, provide a value from your string resources, for example, which will be used as the preference's caption.

```
<im.delight.android.countries.CountryPreference
	android:key="country"
	android:title="..."
	android:enabled="true"
	android:selectable="true" />
```

### Retrieving a list of all supported short codes

```
String[] countryCodes = CountryList.getMachineReadable(context);
// countryCodes now contains "CHN", "IND", "USA", "IDN", "BRA" etc.
```

### Retrieving a list of all supported full names

```
String[] countryNames = CountryList.getHumanReadable(context);
// countryNames now contains "China", "India", "United States", "Indonesia", "Brazil" etc. (depending on the user's locale)
```

### Getting a country's full name by its short code

```
String localizedName = Country.getNameByIso3Code(context, "ESP");
// localizedName now contains "Spain" or "Espa√±a" (etc.) depending on the user's locale
```

## Adding new countries

 1. Create a new entry at the end of the string array `countries_short_codes` in `res/values/short_codes.xml`
 2. Add the full name of the country (at least for English) to our [platform for managed translations](http://www.localize.io/v/3l)
 3. Create a new entry at the end of the string array `countries_full_names` in `res/values/full_names.xml`, referencing the new `country_xxx` resource that has just been submitted in the step before

## Translating country names

If you want to translate existing country names, please do so on our [platform for managed translations](http://www.localize.io/v/3l).
